It was created as part of a class project to help rease awareness for the importance
of the types of plants in Delaware that damage the land and the local ecosystem

How To Play:
The game has three types of plants. Native, Non-Native, and Invasive.

As the game scrolls, you have to pick up the Native plants and Ignore the non-native, invasive and 
other opstacles

Native Plants will maintain or improve the air quality (graphically represented on the top panel) and
the water quality (represented on the righ side). 

Picking up non-native or invasive plants will still help with the water quality of the environment displayed
on the left, but will do damage to the astraunaut's life. 

When a plant is picked up, it shows up on the left panel. If the plant is native, an animal will show up 
next to the plant on the left. 

The bottom panel will show the duration of the effectiveness of the plants that are picked up.
